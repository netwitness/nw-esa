# Module Definition Properties
module_name=Lateral Movement Suspected Windows
module_desc=Lateral Movement Suspected Windows
module_desc_long=Detects within a Windows environment a sequence of events in which an executable is copied to a file share, the executable is used to create a new service and the service is started within 5 minutes. The time window is configurable.  All events must be logged for the same event computer.  The sequence of events may indicate an attacker moving laterally by executing a backdoor on a victim machine from an already compromised system.  Detailed file audit logging must be enabled for the file copy event to be recorded.  A Microsoft Windows log parser must be enabled. This rule uses non-standard meta keys of "event.computer", "service.name" and "disposition" and so they must be indexed by the Log Decoder within the table-map.xml file and the Concentrator within the index-concentrator-custom.xml file.
