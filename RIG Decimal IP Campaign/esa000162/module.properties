module_desc_long=This rule indicates the presence of decimal-IP (i.e., an IP address expressed in decimal format) redirectors in use with RIG Exploit Kit (EK) operations.\n\nREFERENCES\nReference the RSA Link blog post from RSA Research for more details about this threat: https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/rig-decimal-ip-campaign\n\nVERSIONS SUPPORTED\n* 10.6.2.1 and higher\n* 10.6.2 and prior (see CONFIGURATION)\n\nCONFIGURATION\nTo enable for ESA 10.6.2 and prior, you must make the keys 'analysis_service' and 'ioc' multi-valued types. To do this, go to the NetWitness UI > Administration > Services > ESA > Explore > Workflow > Source > nextgenAggregationSource > ArrayFieldNames.  Enter the keys separated by commas and restart the ESA service.  If you have other ESA rules using those keys, they will need to be rewritten to use array syntax and redeployed.  For more information, see https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-76158\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n* HTTP_lua Lua parser\n* Rig Exploit Kit application rule
